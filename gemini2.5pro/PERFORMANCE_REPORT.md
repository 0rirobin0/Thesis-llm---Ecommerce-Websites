### Front-End Performance Report

This report details an analysis of the website's front-end performance, focusing on the critical rendering path, asset loading, and image optimization.

### **Prioritized Performance Checklist & Fixes**

1.  **[CRITICAL] Defer JavaScript Execution:**
    *   **Problem:** The JavaScript files (`products.js`, `app.js`) are parser-blocking. The browser must download, parse, and execute them before it can finish rendering the page, even though they are not needed for the initial paint. This delays the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
    *   **Fix Implemented:** Added the `defer` attribute to all `<script>` tags in the HTML files. This ensures the scripts are downloaded asynchronously and executed only after the HTML document has been fully parsed, without blocking rendering.

2.  **[HIGH] Lazy-Load Offscreen Images:**
    *   **Problem:** On the products page, all product images are loaded immediately, even those that are not in the user's viewport. This wastes bandwidth and slows down the initial page load.
    *   **Fix Implemented:** Added the native `loading="lazy"` attribute to all product `<img>` tags generated by JavaScript. This tells the browser to only load images when they are about to enter the viewport.

3.  **[HIGH] Optimize Image Sizes with Responsive Images:**
    *   **Problem:** The website uses large, high-resolution images from Pexels for product thumbnails and details. These images are not optimized and are much larger than needed for their display size, especially on mobile devices.
    *   **Fix Implemented:**
        *   The `image` property in `products.js` was updated to be a base URL.
        *   The JavaScript in `app.js` now dynamically constructs a `srcset` attribute for each product image. This provides the browser with multiple image sizes (e.g., 400w, 800w, 1200w), allowing it to download the most appropriate size based on the user's device and viewport. This significantly reduces the initial image payload.

4.  **[MEDIUM] Minify and Concatenate Assets:**
    *   **Problem:** The CSS and JavaScript files are served unminified, containing unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments) that increase file size. They are also served as separate files, requiring multiple HTTP requests.
    *   **Fix Proposed:** While not applied directly to the source code, I have provided an optimization script (`optimize.js`) that uses `terser` and `csso` to minify the JavaScript and CSS files into a `dist` directory. In a production environment, the HTML files would be updated to point to these minified assets.

5.  **[MEDIUM] Automate Image Compression:**
    *   **Problem:** Manually optimizing every image is tedious and error-prone.
    *   **Fix Proposed:** The provided `optimize.js` script also uses the `sharp` library to find all JPEG images, resize them to a maximum width, and compress them with a lower quality setting, outputting them to the `dist` directory.

6.  **[LOW] Caching with localStorage:**
    *   **Analysis:** The current use of `localStorage` is appropriate for this project's constraints (no backend). It effectively caches the cart and order data on the client-side. No changes are needed here, but for a larger application, this would be replaced by server-side sessions and a database.
